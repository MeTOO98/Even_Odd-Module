# Even_Odd

**Even_Odd** is a simple Python module that provides two functions to determine whether a given number is even, odd, or zero. The module demonstrates two different methods to perform this check â€” using the remainder operator and bitwise operations.

## Features

- Check if a number is even, odd, or zero.
- Two different implementation techniques:
  - Modulo-based check.
  - Bitwise-based check.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Even_Odd.git
cd Even_Odd


Then import the functions into your Python code:

from Even_Odd import even_odd1, even_odd2
